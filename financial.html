        <section id="The 5 Principles of Financial Literacy">
            <h2>The 5 Principles of Financial Literacy</h2>
            <p>There are five principles of financial literacy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earning</li>
                <li>Saving and investing</li>
                <li>Borrowing and managing your debt</li>

            <p>These principles of financial literacy serve as a road map for good money management and are the establishment of a solid financial foundation. Learning about them — and putting them into practice — can improve your financial situation now and in the future.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Earning">
            <h2>Earning</h2>
            <p>Your income is the foundation of your personal finances. It is the basis for your lifestyle and your financial future. </p>
            <h3>Implementing the Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn to live within your means and pay for your lifestyle without excessive debt.</li>
                <li>Manage your income and workplace benefits. </li>
                <li>Take advantage of employer matches for your 401(k) or similar retirement plans. </li>
                <li>Find ways to put aside portions of your income for the future. </li>
                <li>Set up automatic retirement plan contributions so you won’t be tempted to skip a contribution toward your retirement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Saving and Investing">
            <h2>Saving and Investing</h2>
            <p>Creating a budget will help you put aside money for savings and investments. This allows you to grow your wealth and can empower you to make major financial plans such as buying a house or paying for retirement. </p>
            <h3>Implementing the Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor where your money is going each month.</li>
                <li>Cut out optional expenses for things you can live without and put the money into savings or investments such as an IRA, investment fund or annuity for retirement.</li>
                <li>Create separate categories or “buckets” in which you can set money aside for specific goals from holiday presents to vacations to home purchase to retirement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Borrowing and Debt Management">
            <h2>Borrowing and Debt Management</h2>
            <p>Borrowing wisely will allow you to make major purchases while building your credit. This can help you pay for a home, car or a college education. But avoid excessive debt that can eat into your ability to save and invest in the future.</p>
            <h3>Implementing the Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully weigh major loans to determine if you can afford them — make sure you live within your means.</li>
                <li>Review and compare interest rates before applying for a loan.</li>
                <li>Keep debt to a minimum and easily manageable within your budget.</li>
                <li>Pay your bills on time and make more than the minimum payment.</li>
                <li>Monitor your credit score.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Spending and Planning">
            <h2>Spending and Planning</h2>
            <p>When you get your paycheck, consider following the 50-30-20 budget or the 80-20 strategy.</p>
            <p>Following the 50-30-20 budget means putting 50% of it toward needs, 30% toward wants and the remaining 20% toward savings and investments. This is one of several personal finance strategies that can help you keep your spending on track.</p>
            <p>With the 80-20 budget, you “pay yourself first” by setting aside 20% for savings, then using the remaining 80% for both fixed and variable expenses.</p>
            <h3>Implementing the Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shop for the best value when making purchases.</li>
                <li>When making a large purchase, consider whether it is a need or a want and consider whether buying it is within your means.</li>
                <li>Consider “paying yourself first” by making it a habit to set money for savings aside before anything else to shape and drive your budget.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section id="Protecting your assests">
            <h2>Protecting your assests</h2>
            <p>You will need to protect your financial assets: savings, investments and your budget. This can take the form of an emergency fund and insurance.</p>  
            <h3>Implementing the Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an emergency fund — enough money to pay for three to six months of expenses.</li>
                <li>Determine with your spouse or partner what constitutes an emergency and only dip into the fund for those situations.</li>
                <li>Purchase insurance to cover risk to yourself and your belongings. Consider homeowners or renters insurance, health insurance, car insurance, disability insurance and life insurance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="How To Set Financial Goals">
            <h2>How To Set Financial Goals</h2>
            <p>To set financial goals, start by distinguishing between short-term and long-term objectives. Short-term goals focus on immediate needs or desires. Long-term goals encompass longer-term milestones like retirement or buying a house.</p>
            <p>Determine how much money you need to achieve each goal. You'll need to consider factors like inflation and time horizons — the amount of time left before your goal. You can break down the goals into smaller milestones and create a timeline for accomplishment.</p>
            <p>You can use tools like spreadsheets for budgeting apps to track your progress. And you should regularly reassess and adjust your goals as circumstances change.</p>
            <p>Celebrating milestones along the way will help you stay motivated.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="How To Create a Budget">
            <h2>How To Create a Budget</h2>
            <p>A budget is a plan for spending your money each month. Creating a budget will help make sure you don’t run out of money before the month is up. You can also use it to save money to pay for long-term goals.</p>
            <p>Begin creating your budget by making a list of your monthly expenses.</p>

            <h3>Expenses can include</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rent and other bills that are the same each month</li>
                <li>Utilities and other bills that are different each month</li>
                <li>Car insurance and other bills you may only pay once or twice a year</li>
                <li>Clothes</li>
                <li>Credit card bills</li>
                <li>Entertainment</li>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>Gas and transportation</li>
                <li>School suplies</li>
                <li>Unplanned expenses such as home or car repairs and medical expenses</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now, figure out your income. Write down how much money you make every month. Include all forms of money, like paychecks, tips, side jobs or child support. </p>
            <p>Finally, subtract your expenses from your total income. If the number is less than zero, you are spending more than you make. You’ll need to look for places to cut back your expenses or find a way to make more money.</p>
            <p>If you get a number greater than zero, this is money you can budget each month toward savings or some other financial goal</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Using your budget">
            <h2>Using your budget</h2>
            <p>You can use your budget to make a plan at the beginning of each month on how you will spend the money you earn. </p>
            <p>Keep track of your spending by writing down everything you spent each day — or keep track using an app. At the end of the month, you can see where your money went.</p>
            <p>This can help you adjust your spending. You may discover expenses that you can cut back on — or eliminate.</p>
            <p>Use this knowledge to adjust your next month’s budget. If you do this every month, you’ll eventually fine tune your spending and saving to make it more manageable and efficient. And it can help you start saving more.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="How To Save Money">
            <h3>How To Save Money</h3>
            <p>To create savings, start by setting up a dedicated savings account. Making a separate account will help you separate your savings from your everyday expenses.</p>
            <p>Next, make regular deposits into this account, whether it’s weekly, monthly or based on your paycheck. Consistency is key. </p>
            <p>Automating your savings deposits can keep your deposits consistent. Direct deposits from your job mean you won’t notice a portion of your income going into savings. Automated deposits can keep you from skipping one. You also won’t forget to make a deposit.</p>
            <p>By following these simple steps, you will build up your savings over time.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="How To Invest Money">
            <h2>How To Invest Money</h2>
            <p>When you invest your money, it’s essential to have a clear financial goal in mind. Most people invest for retirement, but others invest for specific purposes like buying a home or paying for their children’s education. </p>
            <p>Starting with employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, can be a great way to begin investing, especially if your employer matches your contributions. By consistently putting money into these plans, you can build significant savings over time. </p>
            <p>Different investment options, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, come with different benefits and risks. It’s essential to know the level of risk you’re comfortable with and balance that against your financial goals. This balance varies from person to person, so understanding your risk tolerance is crucial. </p>
            <p>Finally, the amount you should invest depends on your unique financial situation and goals. It’s never too late to start investing, but the earlier you begin, the more time your investment portfolio has to grow.</p>
